# City Harvest, Grocery Store Data Visualization Project

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Advanced Data Visualization with Tableau course, where I analyzed data collected from City Harvest, a small fictional grocery store in San Francisco. The goal was to visualize and gain insights into the store's sales, website development, online checkout process, and delivery radius using Tableau.

## Dataset Description
The datasets used for this project include:
- *Grocery Sales Data:* Contains information about the store's sales, including product categories, total units sold, revenue, promotions, costs, and profit.
- *Website Project Data:* Includes the project plan for creating the delivery website, with tasks, assigned team members, task durations, and start and end dates.
- *Online Checkout Data:* Provides details on the stages of the online delivery checkout process, including product selection, payment, and order completion.
- *San Francisco Spatial Data:* Holds geographic information about the neighborhoods in San Francisco, used for determining the delivery radius.

## Objectives
- Analyze sales data to identify trends and patterns.
- Visualize the website project plan and progress.
- Understand the customer journey through the online checkout process.
- Determine the optimal delivery radius using spatial data.

## Tools Used
- Tableau for data visualization
- Excel/Google Sheets for basic data cleaning
- GitHub for version control and project documentation

## Visualizations Created
- Sales dashboards showing product performance and revenue trends.
- Gantt charts for visualizing website project timelines.
- Funnel charts illustrating the online checkout process.
- Geographic maps highlighting delivery radius and customer locations.

## Data Output:
Saved the Tableau visualizations to my Tableau Public account and also exported the visualizations in .pptx format which are uploaded in this repository.
